# Photo Classification Application

This repository contains  small Photo Classification Application, a Python-based tool developed as part of the project at the National Research University Higher School of Economics. The application is designed to classify photos into custom groups using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Photo Classification Application uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically the ResNet model, to classify and sort images into user-defined categories. This project focuses on the efficiency and accuracy of image classification, considering constraints such as dataset size and computational power. 

The application allows users to set their own categories for auto-classification of photos, keeping their camera rolls organized and structured. It was developed using Python and the PyTorch machine learning framework.

## Features

- Image classification by custom classes
- Ability to save the model for later use without retraining
- Option to add new examples to the training dataset for fine-tuning
